## **🎯 Ticket Strategy**

  

### **Priorities**

- ✅ Group games near booked stays (NYC, Miami, Vegas, LA)
    
- ✅ Follow Australia if they qualify — ideally Group K
    
- ✅ Knockouts if they align with roadtrip flow
    

  

### **Flex Factors**

- 💤 Overnight stays flexible for Match 29/30
    
- 🚗 Driving vs flying affects feasibility
    
- 📍 Miami base saves money if return is easy
    

---

## **🔁 Resale & Adjustments**

- Use FIFA’s official resale platform for swapping tickets if plans shift
    
- Join Aussie fan groups for trading/selling verified spares
    
- If knocked out early, pivot to big South American match-ups
    

---

## **💸 Budget Planning**

|**Type**|**Est. Cost (USD)**|
|---|---|
|Avg. Group Match|$150–$200|
|Avg. Knockout Match|$220–$280|
|Category upgrades|+$100|
|Resale surcharge|+10–20%|

✅ Stick to max $2,500 per person in ticket budget to balance with flights and stays.
