### 🔄 Option A vs Option B (Ongoing Tracking)

You're trending toward **Option B** — city-to-city, no static base.

**Option B Advantages:**

- Max flexibility around ticket draws
    
- Ability to chase top fan zones + match cities
    
- Greater mix of adventure + fan culture
    

**Option A still possible** if:

- Miami or LA hosts most matches you win in the ballot
    
- Long-stay discounts outweigh flexibility
    
- Content or comfort needs shift
    

We’ll revisit after the match ticket draw.
