## 🧭 Getting There

- **Stadium:** Lincoln Financial Field
    
- **Location:** 1 Lincoln Financial Field Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148
    
- **Public Transit:** Take the SEPTA Broad Street Line to **NRG Station** — it’s the final stop and drops you a short walk from the stadium.
    
- **Rideshare:** Available but traffic-heavy. Ask to be dropped near **Pattison Ave & 11th St** for quicker access.
    

**Wayne-O’s Tip:** Avoid post-match traffic by hanging back and soaking in the fan zone buzz before heading out.

## 🎟️ Seating Tips

- **Lower Sideline (Sections 101–103 & 137–139):** Best view of the full pitch.
    
- **End Zone (North/South Ends):** Good atmosphere, better for budget seats.
    
- **Club Level (200s):** Comfy but pricier, decent amenities.
    

**Fan Energy Zones:** Expect booming chants and flags waving in the **lower north end**, especially if Latin American teams are playing.

## ⚽ Fan Experience Tips

- Join in on Rocky-themed chants or re-enact the stairs run at the **Philadelphia Museum of Art**.

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**

Order a cheesesteak **"wit wiz"** (with cheese whiz). If you don’t, they’ll know you’re a tourist.
