## 🎟️ Seating Tips

- **Lower Bowl (Sections 200s):** Close to the pitch, great energy
    
- **Mid-Tier (300s):** Balanced view + value
    
- **Upper Bowl (500s):** Budget-friendly but still good, especially midfield
    
- **Avoid:** Behind the big screen (limited views)
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**  
If you see a sea of red... follow it. Canadian fans go big — flags, face paint, moose hats and all.
