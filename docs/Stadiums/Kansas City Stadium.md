## 🚇 Getting There

- **Stadium:** GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium
    
- **Location:** Truman Sports Complex, 1 Arrowhead Dr, Kansas City, MO 64129
    
- **Transport Tips:**
    
    - Rideshare (Uber/Lyft) is easiest.
        
    - Parking is plentiful but pricey — pre-book if you’re driving.
        
    - Public transport options are limited. Consider shuttle services from downtown hotels on match days.
        

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**  
Bring a portable seat cushion. Arrowhead was built for gridiron bums, not your samba-shaking hips.
