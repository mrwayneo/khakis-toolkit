## 🚍 How to Get There

- **Stadium Location:** Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, MA (about 35 km/22 mi from Boston city center).
    
- **Public Transport:**
    
    - **MBTA Train (Event Day Service):** Special trains run from South Station to Foxboro.
        
    - **Driving/Parking:** Allow plenty of time. Parking is well-managed but fills early.
        

**Wayne-O's Transit Tip:** Grab a beer and board the MBTA football express — it’s cheaper and chaos-free.

## 🪑 Seating Tips

- **Best Atmosphere:** Lower Bowl, sideline sections (108–112 or 131–135)
    
- **Budget-Friendly View:** Upper sideline or corner spots — sections 310+ still offer decent angles.
    
- **Avoid:** End zones high up if you're after detail — great for atmosphere but tough to follow tactics.
    

**Wayne-O's Seating Tip:** Go for mid-tier corners — more energy, less wallet damage.

## 🍻 Nearby Fan Bars & Hangouts

While Gillette itself is surrounded mostly by outlets and tailgating fields, hit Boston for:

- **The Banshee (Dorchester)** – Irish pub with wall-to-wall football energy.
    
- **Phoenix Landing (Cambridge)** – Premier League loyalists, now footy-fan central.
    
- **Coppersmith (Southie)** – Rooftop parties and World Cup screens.
    

**Wayne-O's Local Tip:** Pre-load in Boston, ride the train, tailgate on arrival — then reverse it with a hot dog in hand.
