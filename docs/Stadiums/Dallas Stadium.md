## 🧭 Getting There

- **Stadium:** AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas
    
- **By Public Transit:** Not ideal. Closest major hubs are in Dallas (TRE Centreport Station), then Uber/Lyft to stadium.
    
- **Rideshare Zones:** Well-marked near Lot 15.
    
- **Parking:** Prepaid recommended (expensive). Tailgating allowed — come early.
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**  
Book a shared shuttle with other fans and BYO esky. You’ll arrive buzzing and budget-friendly.

## 🪑 Seating Tips

- **Lower Level Sidelines (100s):** Pure atmosphere, especially if Brazil or Argentina are playing.
    
- **Endzones (200s–300s):** Affordable but loud and rowdy.
    
- **Club Levels:** Comfier seating and better facilities, but you’ll miss the raw energy.
    

Avoid corners unless you’re there for the price or to make trouble.

💡 **Fan Energy:**  
AT&T is where Latin America turns up the volume. Expect drums, dancing, chants, and maybe a mariachi band on the concourse.

**Local Phrase:** "Y’all ready for this?!" – Best response is just a nod and a loud chant.
