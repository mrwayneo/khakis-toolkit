## **🚇 Getting There**

- **Link Light Rail:** Take the **Stadium Station** stop. Simple and fast.
    
- **Walk from Downtown:** If you're staying downtown, it’s a 15-20 minute walk.
    
- **Uber/Lyft:** Drop-off at Occidental Ave is common.
    
- **Driving?** Use **CenturyLink Garage** or nearby lots, but prepare for traffic.
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:** Get off at International District/Chinatown Station for pregame eats and an easier post-match exit.

## **🎟️ Seating Tips**

- **Sections 100–144:** Lower bowl, closest to the action.
    
- **Hawk's Nest (North End):** Affordable, electric atmosphere.
    
- **Club Level (200s):** Great views, pricier, but cushy.
    
- **300s (Upper Bowl):** Budget-friendly but still excellent views.
    

**Avoid:** Very back rows under the overhang — blocked views of sky and pyro.
