## 🚇 Getting There

- **Public Transit:** Take NJ Transit or Coach USA buses from Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. Or ride the Meadowlands Rail Service from Secaucus Junction.
    
- **Subway Hack:** Use NYC subway to Penn Station, transfer to NJ Transit.
    
- **Driving?** Expect serious match-day traffic. Parking is limited — book early.
    

**Wayne-O's Tip:** Bring a transit card + mobile ticket app (NJ Transit). And wear comfy shoes — it's a bit of a walk from drop-off to stadium entrance.

## 🧭 Local Lingo & Tips

- “Uptown” = North, “Downtown” = South.
    
- Say “subway” not “metro.”
    
- Tipping is expected: 15–20%.
    
- Best skyline views: Brooklyn Bridge at dusk.
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**

Catch the sunset skyline view from Hoboken Pier before heading to the stadium — prime selfie material.
