## 🚇 How to Get There

- **By Transit:**
    
    - **TTC:** Take Line 1 to Union Station, then transfer to the **504 King streetcar** westbound to Exhibition Loop.
        
    - **GO Train:** Direct service to **Exhibition GO Station** (Lakeshore West line).
        
- **By Bike/Scooter:** Waterfront trails make for a scenic pregame ride.
    
- **Driving Tip:** Avoid if possible — limited parking and game-day traffic can be a nightmare.
    

**Wayne-O’s Transit Hack:** Stay near Union Station. It’s your gateway to the entire city (and postgame poutine).

## 🪑 Seating Tips

- **East Stand:** Great views with sunset behind you.
    
- **South End:** Home to the loudest fans — expect drums, chants, and passion.
    
- **West Stand:** Premium seating and good shade.
    
- **North End:** Budget-friendly and family-oriented.
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:** Sit near the south end if you want the _“proper”_ football experience — but leave your voice at the door, you’ll lose it.
