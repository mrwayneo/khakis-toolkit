## **📍 Sample Stadium Guide — Hard Rock Stadium, Miami**

  

### **Stadium Overview**

- **Name**: Hard Rock Stadium
    
- **Location**: Miami Gardens, Florida
    
- **Capacity**: 65,000+
    
- **Home to**: Miami Dolphins (NFL), big concerts, and now your World Cup dreams.
    

  

### **How to Get There**

- **West Side**: Better shade and breeze.
    
- **Lower Bowl**: For fans who want to be loud and proud.
    
- **Corners**: Often the cheapest tickets, but still a killer view of the action.
    

  

### **Fan Zones Nearby**

- **Wynwood District** — pre/post-match murals, music, and beer halls.
    

  

### **Food & Drink Must-Knows**

- Try local bites: **Cuban sandwiches**, **Arepas**, and **Jupina soda**.
    
- Stadium beers run $15+ — hydrate first!
    

  

### **Security & Entry Tips**

- No bags over A4 size unless clear.
    
- Portable battery packs allowed, but no camera rigs.

If someone offers to trade shirts after the game — **do it**. Stories last longer than jerseys.
