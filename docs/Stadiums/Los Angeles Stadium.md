## 🚇 How to Get There

- **Metro:** Use the **C Line (Green)** to **Hawthorne/Lennox Station** then take a SoFi shuttle.
    
- **Rideshare:** Drop-off zones are efficient but expect post-match surge pricing.
    
- **Driving:** Parking is available but pricey (pre-book if possible).
    
- **Bike/Scooter:** LA has rentals galore — just avoid the freeways!
    

**Wayne-O’s Local Tip:**  
If traffic feels like it hasn’t moved in 20 minutes… that’s just LA being LA. Leave early and blast the pre-match playlist.
